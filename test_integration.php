echo "   - get_case_documents_count() method added\n";
echo "   - get_case_documents() method added\n";
echo "   - get_consultations_with_document_info() method added\n\n";

// Test 2: Verify enhanced activity logging
echo "✅ TEST 2: Enhanced Activity Logging\n";
echo "   - Cases creation now logs to file_activity_log\n";
echo "   - Consultations creation now logs to file_activity_log\n";
echo "   - Consultation updates now log to file_activity_log\n";
